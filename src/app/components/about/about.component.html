        Hello! I'm Ashbir, a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience building 
        scalable web applications. My journey in software development began during my studies 
        at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I learned the fundamentals of 
        computer engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in Java and Spring Boot for backend development, with experience in building 
        RESTful APIs, implementing security measures, and optimizing database performance. I'm also 
        proficient in frontend technologies like Angular, allowing me to work across the full stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I have hands-on experience with cloud-native 
        development and deploying applications in containerized environments. I'm passionate about 
        clean code, automated testing, and cross-functional collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
        and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
      </p>
